Project: TMDb Movie Data Analysis

## Introduction

We always find behind each art or product someone who works with infatuation and passion and shows to us what we do not see, therefore the author is that person who has a great interest in films and watching. And He asks us:
What shows us whether the film is good or bad? there are should be factors that influence this. Through that, I tried to present something good through this project and find some a logical analysis that adds some good notes and I present them to author.

A note specifying which dataset you analyzed

Depending on link of Google doc. Then, I chose TMDb movie data. This data set contains information more than 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.

## Attribute Information
